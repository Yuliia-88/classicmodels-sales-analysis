# ClassicModels Data Analysis with Python + SQL
## 📌 Project Overview 
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the ClassicModels database, which contains detailed information on customers, orders, products, and sales.
The goal is to uncover patterns in sales performance, inventory levels, seasonality, customer behavior, and key drivers of profitability.

## 🎯 Research Objectives
- Analyze product inventory and identify which items contribute to the largest stock levels.
- Conduct order analytics for the year 2004 and determine leading countries and customers.
- Identify top-performing products by revenue, assess their contribution to total sales, and apply Pareto analysis (80/20 rule).
- Explore monthly sales dynamics, growth trends, seasonality, and the relationship between order volume and average order value.
